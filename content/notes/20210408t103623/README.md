I can say with absolute certainty that if I didn’t need a twitter account for my career, I’d delete it forever. It’s mind numbingly addictive and awful.

The problem I have with it is that I can’t use it only a bit, or for a short time. It’s all or nothing. And I’m starting to get the addicts clarity that maybe I need to go cold turkey.
