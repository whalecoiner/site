> Hmm, funny that, because I remember it being when a load of Silicon Valley cunts invented the concept in order to economise on hiring, but what they really did was economise on frontend quality by hiring backend devs and forcing them to do frontend and that's what led to the state of the web today but why don't you go ahead and invent whatever fucking history makes you feel comfortable, fuckmouth.
