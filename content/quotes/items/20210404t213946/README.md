  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My theory of tech
  debt is that housework is the correct metaphor for the thing we call tech
  debt, but we can&#39;t use it because tech has been made up of people who
  don&#39;t do housework, or manage housework being done.</p>&mdash; Yvonne Lam
