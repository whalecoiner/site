  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For 8000 years you
  have been jealous that we can give birth, that we decide who is our
  sex-partner, that we are living godesses. For all this time you have tried to
  marginalize and destroy us. Now you can chose to BE us, supported by
  feminists. Final goal of patriarchy is near.</p>&mdash; Rona Duwe (@maurakami)
