## A/S/L?

I'm a 40-something woman living in [Berlin](/posts/berlin), Germany (the famous one, with the wall).

## How do you sell your labor in order to survive in a capitalist system?

I'm a front end developer, which means I build the interfaces for the sites that you use every day. I specialise in creating simple, robust, and inclusive solutions. I have no time for the latest trends that appease the technological fetishising areas of the web community.



## Personal

If you define me as a _person_ then I'm a [photography-taking](https://flickr.com/photos/sonniesedge), bike riding, beer drinking, feminist leftie. 

I read more than is healthy, and spend as much time as I can exploring the beautiful world we inhabit.

## Bonus fact

I have voluntary control of my [tensor tympani muscles](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle).

## Quotes about me

- "Well, you _do_ have a touch of the German techno-anarchist about you!"
- "You're intimidating."
- "Will you stop that for god's sake??"
