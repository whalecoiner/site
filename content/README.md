Keep it simple, sasa que?

You can do that by:

- Putting people before code.
- Replacing Consumer Capitalism with something kinder.
- Choosing simple solutions before technological masturbation.
- The benefits of Pina Coladas and walks in the rain.
- Building robust sites before jumping at fragile frameworks.
- Using tech for the greater good.
