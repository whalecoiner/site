> almost no text-level semantic element has a direct mapping to any accessible object

Ouch, this sounds worrying. But then you read the rest of this article and you realise just how overused things like `<strong>` and `<em>` are. I suspect that HTML tags like this are still an easy way for some devs to add visual styling, as opposed to writing the necessary CSS. A relic of [The Bad Old Days](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font) come to haunt us.
