While I normally pass over atomic class CSS systems, because of their lack of scalability within any kind of non-startup organisation size, the ability to extract atomic-classes into components looks interesting. 

> Tailwind provides tools for extracting component classes from repeated utility patterns, making it easy to update multiple instances of a component from one place. 

I still think it's the wrong choice for anything that isn't disposable, but the component-extraction makes it a bit more flexible and palatable .
