<blockquote>Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into a something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD.</blockquote>
