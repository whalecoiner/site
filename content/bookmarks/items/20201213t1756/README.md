An absolutely incredible interview with Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera about being trans in 1979s New York. 

Show this to any transphobes who try and claim that these two wonderful women were actually gay men appropriated by the trans movement. Marsha talks about her hormone treatment and seeking surgery FFS!
