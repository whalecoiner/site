> so the Full Stack Developer emerges in the market, like an Uruk-hai emerging from its grimy placenta: stronger, better, problematic.

Heydon always gives good blog, and when writing about "full-stack development" his vitriol is upgraded from tactical to strategic. 

I have equally big problems with the concept of "full-stack". It's a concept that always necessitates a sacrifice, of either less-privileged developers (as Heydon eloquently snarls), or of the end users. 

The most vulnerable users depend upon the expertise of an accessibility and robustness aware front-end developer, yet they are, once "full-stack" gets involved, at the tender mercies of a dev who has never been told "no" and who therefore thinks he can do anything in life, despite getting quickly bored of anything to do with accessibility, UX, or other icky girly things.

"Full-stack" development can, frankly, strap itself to the back of an elderly incontinent cow and follow it into the mincers of the factory farm. 

Fucking come at me, bros. I'm ready for a smackdown.
