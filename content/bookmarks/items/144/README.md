> This is just a silly idea, a CSS "library" that styles tags directly — as opposed to using class names as style hooks — to help people become more familiar with how to use semantic HTML.

This is definitely not a silly idea. Styling base components first and then overriding with classed components is a very useful technique. It's especially useful when combined with [graded browser support](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook/blob/master/practices/graded-browser-support.md).
