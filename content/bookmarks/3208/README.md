> 5G just might make web performance worse, not better, for the average person.

Why?

> ... historically, faster network speed has enabled developers to deliver more code to users—in particular, more JavaScript code.

Go on...

> On the average devices still in use today, 200kb of JavaScript (compressed for transfer) can take 6 or more seconds to parse—and that’s after the time it takes to download the code over the network.

> The average device is not the brand new thousand-dollar iPhone with 3 lenses for taking photographs. The average device even in the US is the sort of device that you see on the Amazon Best Sellers, which can run about $130. 

So, the availability of faster networks will likely lead to developers sending more imperative code down the wire to devices that can't handle it.

Nice work, devs.
