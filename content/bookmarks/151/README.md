> You might expect that if the ability to cram ever more data onto magnetic disks is diminishing, so too must this be true for tape. The surprising reality is that for tape, this scaling up in capacity is showing no signs of slowing. Indeed, it should continue for many more years at its historical rate of about 33 percent per year, meaning that you can expect a doubling in capacity roughly every two to three years. Think of it as a Mooreâ€™s Law for magnetic tape.

Oooh, this is very interesting. I like the idea of tape. It slows things down.
