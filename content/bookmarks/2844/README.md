An excellent summary of the whole `<toast>` situation and the worries of those in the standards community. It's not about Google proposing a new HTML element. It's about Google dominating the conversation _without even realising_ it. 

The parallels between this, unacknowledged privilege, and intersectionality are fascinating.
