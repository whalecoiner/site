> The codebase of Gutenberg is difficult for all of us, because no one in the wpa11y team is a skilled REACT developer. So it was hard to implement changes and write PRs ourselves. What we could do is test, tell whatâ€™s wrong and what it should be and hope a developer would pick it up.

It is so sad to see WordPress descend into inaccessible design and a fragile JS-first mindset. 

It's now apparently impossible to build form inputs without a framework. ?
