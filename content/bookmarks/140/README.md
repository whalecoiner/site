> As a general trend, we’re not getting faster software with more features. We’re getting faster hardware that runs slower software with the same features. Everything works way below the possible speed. 

I empathise a lot with this post. Every time I upgrade my laptop, it gets slower. Each new app seems to aim to do more, while somehow doing less.

This trend is especially apparent in frontend web design. We're doing _pretty much the same as 10 years ago_ but with pages that are 100 times larger, and interfaces that are horrifically slow on anything but the latest iPhone and Mac. 

We've sacrificed elegance, sleekness, and robustness for the ability to "pivot" and boot up sites and apps quickly in order to appease angel investors. 

With this article, and many others,I hope we're seeing the start of a swing back to slowness and simplicity.
