But this is the key takeaway, I feel. I've long argued that accessibility, performance, and robustness are akin to the Basic Expectations in the UX and Product world's [Kano Model](https://foldingburritos.com/kano-model/). If the basic expectations of a product are not met then anything you try to build on top of that is doomed to failure. 

We need a Kano Model for how we develop websites. This article makes that argument beautifully.
