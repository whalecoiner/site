This is definitely not an endorsement bookmark. It's more of a "did I miss something?" bookmark. For example, did I miss that The Guardian, while very popular, isn't actually that complicated a fucking  website, and in fact seems to have been infected by the curse of People Who Want To Be Computer Scientists and Engineers?
