> To decarbonize, we need to decomputerize.

_nods, hugely_

> We should destroy machinery hurtful to the common good and build machinery helpful to it.

I'm at that point in my life where I'm quite happy to see every computer in the world get pissed on until it shuts down forever. 

Computers were great at first, but I'm not seeing what good mass computerisation is bringing to the world now.

Or maybe this is all a nostalgic yearning for the 1980s.
