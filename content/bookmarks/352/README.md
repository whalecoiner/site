<blockquote>Dress Code is a style guide and pattern library for building websites rapidly, designed for maintainability and modularity. It was initially conceived as a styleguide for Zalando's Brand Solutions applications.  Component organization is based on atomic design. The style is written in SASS, class naming follows BEM, and properties are ordered according to SMACSS.</blockquote>
