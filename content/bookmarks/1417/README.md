> Critics of “useless products” are sitting at the core of a battle the disability community has been engaged in for decades: The right to live in their communities, and to receive the services that enable them to do that. If you can’t use your hands to open a jar of pasta sauce, does that mean you should live in an institution?

Many of the "useless" products that we like to mock are actually life-enabling for disabled users. 

The same applies to so much of the web!
