Learn about:  - Yeoman, Grunt and Bower  - Brand new features in Chrome DevTools  - Alfred workflows  - Tools for live editing and debugging CSS/JS/HTML with Chrome  - Productivity tools for Sublime  - Tools for synchronised cross-device mobile testing  - Network throttling tools  - Visual regression testing tools  and much more.
