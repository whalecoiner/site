<blockquote>Modal Dialogs are a tricky thing to make accessible. For visual users navigating with a mouse, creating a dialog is as simple as styling the element to look visually different from the rest of the page. However, users navigating a site via a keyboard and/or screenreader need a lot more.</blockquote>
