In March 1989, while I was busy traversing the difficult jump from 9 years old to 10 years old, a little something called the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee.

30 years ago. Oh my.  

I didn't see any evidence for the WWW, or indeed the internet, for another decade when I got to university. 

When I did, my world changed. Thank you Tim. ♥️
