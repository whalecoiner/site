> Last summer we learned that Apple was working on a series adaptation of the 1981 time traveling fantasy Time Bandits. The movie hails from Monty Python troupe member Terry Gilliam, and now itâ€™s being handed off to a worthy successor. Thor: Ragnarok and What We Do in the Shadows director Taika Waititi has boarded the Time Bandits series as co-writer and director. 

This is perhaps the best TV series news I've heard for a while. ðŸŽ‰
