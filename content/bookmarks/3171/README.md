This is a great way of looking at what we build on the web. Rather than a simplistic "web site" vs "web app" this categorization actually distinguishes between a number of different implementations. 

Most importantly  it describes what is the best way of implementing each holotype. A graphical image editor or game, for example, is almost always best implemented using Client Side Rendering. Meanwhile a news website or blog is always best implemented via Server Side Rendering. 

I think Holotypes is a great way of thinking about things that we find on the web.

As I've always stated, I firmly believe that95% of sites out there fall into the Content holotype...
