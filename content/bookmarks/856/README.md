A large part of a Front End Ops Engineer's role is to focus away from feature development so that others can create features faster, more robustly and with less risk to the rest of the site. Lonelyplanet.com is driven by huge expectation, a rapid delivery cycle and never enough developers -- ordinarily a recipe for bug-ridden code. I plan to talk about how we de-risked UI development through the creation of a Component API and how we changed our development methodology in order to reduce the inherent complexity of maintaining a big site.
