> Â a generation of entrepreneurs encouraged to make more narrow-minded, web-hostile products ... because it continues to make a small number of wealthy people even more wealthy, instead of letting lots of people build innovative new opportunities for themselves on top of the web itself.

This matches my feelings 100%. We've lost so much of the weird wild web and turned it over to boring centralised corporate apps. 

I want the web back.
