  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should cis women
  allies be joining Mumsnet to resist transphobia? The site has long been at the
  front lines of radicalising T*RFs with little to no resistance. What would
  happen if more cis women took the time to disagree, offer alternative
  viewpoints and say &quot;Not in Our Name&quot;?</p>&mdash; ciswomanagainst
