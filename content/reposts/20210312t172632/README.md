  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d just say to
  younger trans women that Twitter is unrepresentative and ALL the cis feminists

  selfish for saying “me too” or expressing fear. You also don’t owe anyone a
  narrative of your trauma ❤️</p>&mdash; shon faye. (@shonfaye) <a
