Youtube really really wants to load. Really, reallllllly, wants to. But then it fucks things up at the last nanosecond and farts out, showing no video, no preview icons, and no comments (that last one is perhaps a positive).

Even if the site is doing some funky blob loading of video media, it wouldn't be hard to put a basic version on the page initially (with `preload="none"`), and then have it upgrade when JS kicks in.

*Verdict:* Can't watch My Drunk Kitchen or Superwoman. :( :( :(
