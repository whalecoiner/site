I've had this open in my tabs for the last 6 months, meaning to read it. Look, I'M SORRY, okay? But holy fuck, this site works great without javascript. All the animations are there (because they're CSS) and the slide in navigation works (because it internally links to the static version of the menu at the bottom of the page).

*Verdict:* Class act. Smoooooth. Jazzz.
