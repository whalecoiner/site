It's the day after the latest London terrorism attacks, and so I've got this open, just to see how the media intensifies and aids every terrorist action. The BBC is the inventor and poster-child for progressive enhancement via Cutting the Mustard, and it doesn't disappoint. The non-CTM site works fully and while it doesn't _look_ the same as the full desktop site (it's mobile-first and so is pretty much the mobile version), it still _works_.

*Verdict:* Colman's Mustard
