My very first attempt at sans-JS and I get nothing but a blank white page. 

Fuck you feedly. 

Where are you going? I...

_sighs, runs hands over face, shouts after Feedly_.

Wait no, Feedly, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. It was the coffee talking. Can we talk this over? I like using you to keep up with blog posts.

But why do you work like this, Feedly? Your devs _could_ offer the site in basic HTML and use advanced features such as, er, anchor links, to move to other articles. Then when JS is available, new content can be loaded via JS.

*Verdict:* Relationship counselling.
