Twitter shows the normal website (with full content) for a brief moment, then redirects to [mobile.twitter.com](https://mobile.twitter.com) (the old one, not the spanky new React one, of course). This is really frustrating, as the full site would still be great to load without javascript. It could use the same navigation method as the mobile site, where it sets a query parameter to the URL "?max_id=871333359884148737" that dictates what is the latest tweet in your timeline to show. Simple and elegant. 

*Verdict:* Could try harder.
