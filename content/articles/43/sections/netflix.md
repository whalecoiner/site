I'm using netflix to try and indoctrinate my girlfriend into watching Star Trek. So far she's not convinced: "Tasha Yar _slept with Mr Data?_ But that would be like fucking your microwave!"

Anyway, Netflix doesn't work. Well, it loads the header, if you want to count that. I get why they don't do things with HTML5 - DRMing all yo shit needs javascript. But still :(.

*Verdict:* JavaScript-only is the New Black
