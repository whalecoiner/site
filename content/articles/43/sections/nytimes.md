title: New York Times

Not sure why this was in my tab list, but tbh I've found rotting tabs from 2015 in there, so I'm not surprised. 

The NY Times site loads in _561ms_ and 957kb without javascript. Holy crap, that's what it should be like normally. For reference it took 12000ms (12seconds) and 4000kb (4mb) to load _with_ javascript. Oh, and as a bonus, you get a screenful of adverts. 

A lot of images are lazy loaded, and so don't work, getting replaced with funky loading icons. But hey ho, I can still read the stories.

*Verdict:* Failing... to _not_ work. Sad!
