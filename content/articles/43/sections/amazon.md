The site looks a little... _off_ without JS (the myriad accordions vomit their content over the page when JS isn't there to keep them under control). But the entire site works! You can still search, you still get recommendations. You can still add items to your basket, and you can still proceed to the checkout.

*Verdict:* Amazonian warrior.
