I understand the fascination with data visualisation now. This morning my colleague showed me what he was doing with some of the data we had gathered from the general election and - I can't lie - I got a bit excited over it.

As a result I've spent the afternoon playing with D3 and the raw data, and I've learned some useful things. Sadly I can't share any code with you, as the data it relies on is owned by the BBC and I can't republish it (by design D3 requires a publically accessible JSON file to work from). But I can share a screenshot of what I quickly made with D3 and the election data.

It's interesting to consider the adage "[Tories always vote](https://twitter.com/EmmaKennedy/status/596478834788044802)" when looking at this scatter graph. It certainly shows that voter turnout was higher in constituencies where Tories won.
